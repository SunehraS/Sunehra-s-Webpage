    <h1>Favourite Food</h1>
    <p>
      I absolutely love food, and my favorite dish has to be noodles! However, I'm quite particular about the shape of my noodles.
      From spaghetti to ramen, the texture and feel of the noodles matter just as much as the taste. Here are a few of my top picks:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ramen - A perfect balance of broth, noodles, and toppings.</li>
      <li>Spaghetti - Especially when paired with a rich, hearty sauce.</li>
      <li>Pad Thai - Sweet, tangy, and just a little bit spicy!</li>
      <li>Macaroni - A childhood classic that never gets old.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why I Love Noodles</h2>
    <p>
      Noodles are versatile and can adapt to any cuisine. Whether it's Italian, Japanese, or Thai, there's always a way to enjoy them.

    <h2>My Go-To Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      When I’m cooking at home, I love to make stir-fried noodles with lots of vegetables, a savory soy-based sauce, and a hint of chili for some kick. 
      It’s quick, easy, and delicious!
