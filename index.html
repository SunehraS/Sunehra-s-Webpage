    <h1>Welcome to Sunehra's Blog!</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, welcome to my Blog. I've always wanted to create one about unnecessary information about myself and now thanks to my MHI1001 class, I can finally do that. This blog captures everything about me and stuff I like so I hope you appreciate it. <br/>
    </p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi My name is Sunehra and this is the first time I've ever coding anything. I'm currently a Masters of Health Informatics Student at UofT and previously I studied at UofT majoring in Life Sciences. My favourite animal is a cat even though I have a cat allergy and my favourite food is probably noodles but I'm very particular about the shape. In my spare time, I love to shop, listen to music, and watch a really good movie. My favourite Genre is Horror, Rom Coms, and Comedy in no particular order. I would consider myself an introvert but I think it depends highly on the environment. 
    </p>
    <h2>This is my Cat, Noel.</h2>
<p>
I had to give him away because I developed severe cat allergies. As you can see he's quite the tech wiz himself.
